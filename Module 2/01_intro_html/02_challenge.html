        <p>Nobody’s born smart.<strong> We all start at 0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike</em>.<strong> Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein </em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong> Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br></p>
        <p><strong> You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong></p>
