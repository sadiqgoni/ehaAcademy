<!DOCTYPE HTML><html> <head> <title>Challenge: You can learn text tags</title> <meta charset="utf-8"> </head> <body> <p>Nobody’s born smart.<strong> We all start at 0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br> <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike</em>.<strong> Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br> There was a time when <em>Einstein </em> couldn’t count to 10.<br> And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br> Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br> <em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br> <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br> <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br> One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br> Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br> Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br> <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br> It’s not that you don’t get it. <br> You just don’t get it, yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br> are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br> <strong> Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br></p> <p><strong> You only have to know one thing:</strong><br> <strong>You can learn anything.</strong></p> </body></html>
