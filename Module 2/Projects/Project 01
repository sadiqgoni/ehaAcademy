      <ul>
         <li><strong>Nigerian Jollof Rice</strong> made with tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets, and chili peppers. There are endless variations on this recipe, but those five ingredients are usual constants.No list of Nigerian foods can be complete without a mention of Jollof rice. It's a party dish brought out at celebrations and a signature regional dish.</li>

         <li><strong>Pounded yams</strong> are considered a fufu (a kind of starchy side dish) usually served with a stew or efo.One could compare pounded yams to mashed potatoes, but that'd be doing a disservice to the magically pull apart dough-like texture attained by this dish,And you don't need a mortar and pestle to cook pounded yams you can make them with a hand mixer, a blender, or yam flour.</li>

         <li><strong>Ofada Stew</strong> is a stew made with spicy scotch bonnets, smoked dried shrimp, and iru (also known as locust beans or dawa dawa).This is one of those dishes whose very image inspires appetites from the pickiest of eaters. Be careful though: the dish is pretty spicy and tastes great when paired with tongue-cooling rice.
