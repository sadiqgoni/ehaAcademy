            <p id="para">This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my first year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. 
            This is because I had no real experience doing web development,and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic Python training I got from a few online courses and a Robotic Oraganisation Called Steamledge in Kano.
            I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I started my first college year as a software engineer.<br>I’d never written about my experience despite all the help I’ve received from wonderful resources like Medium, Stack Overflow, and Reddit’s programming subreddits.
            So today, I decided to change that. Today I’m going to fill you in on what went right, and what didn’t, so that if you’re embarking on this journey, you’ll have better luck than I did.</p>

            <p class="para">After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?” After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions asked for, which was:</p>
